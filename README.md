# ðŸ¥Ÿ Dumplingboard

An open-source Starboard clone with dumplings.


## How it works

Essentially the same as the [Starboard](https://top.gg/bot/655390915325591629) bot, but with dumplings instead of stars.

If you're not familiar with it, it works like this:

- Users place dumpling `ðŸ¥Ÿ` reactions under a message
- Once a message gets 3 <sup>(by default, the value can be changed)</sup> or more dumpling reactions, it gets sent to a special channel - Dumplingboard.
- Admins can set the dumplingboard channel and the amount of reactions needed to send a message to the dumplingboard.

So, like, messages "pinned" by community.
